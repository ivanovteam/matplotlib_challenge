The current project was created to check how diffrerent drug regimens are reflecting on the size of mice tumors over time.

The bar chart shows that most of the measurements were done with Capomulin and the Ramicane  and respectively at least amount of measurements were done with Propriva.

The pie chart shows that from the amount of the mice used in this experiment the male mice were only 2% more  which is not significant and the followed treatment results won't deffer based on the gender of the mice.

The lineplot shows how the tumor volume is changing over time when is treated with Capomulin.  It could be concluded that treating a mouse with Capommulin definitely brings the size of the tumor down.

With correlation coefficient at 0.84 there is a clear linear relation between the weight of a mouse and the size of the tumor in cubic millimeters. It is a positive correlation which means that  when one of the variables is increasing the other one is going up as well.
